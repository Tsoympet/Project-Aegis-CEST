# Project Aegis CEST

This repository implements the **Coupled-Envelope Shield Theory (CEST)** for spacecraft protection against **laser**, **charged-particle**, and **hypervelocity debris** threats.

## Key Features
- **Theory and Methodology** for multi-layer shield effectiveness
- **Scenario-based sweeps** for shield performance under mixed threats
- **Python-based calculator** for scenario analysis
- **Open-source repository** with reproducible results

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in **docs/index.md** to run the calculator and simulate scenarios.

## Proof of Concept & Experimental Validation

- **[Proof of Concept](docs/proof_of_concept.md)**: A detailed explanation of the theory and the experimental validation of **Plasma Mirror**, **Magnetic Shielding**, and **Impact Mitigation**.

- **[Experimental Validation](docs/experimental_validation.md)**: This section details the experimental tests and their results validating **CEST**.

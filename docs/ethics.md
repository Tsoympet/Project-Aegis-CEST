# Ethics and Safety

This project implements active defense technologies based on **CEST (Coupled-Envelope Shield Theory)**. The layers of protection involve **plasma mirrors**, **magnetic deflection**, and **Whipple shielding**, and these technologies must be managed in a **dual-use** context.

## Ethical Considerations:
- **Laser Safety**: We ensure that all laser systems operate with **backscatter control** and **eye-safety interlocks** to prevent unintended exposure to radiation.
- **HPM/EMP Shielding**: All systems are designed to meet **electromagnetic shielding** standards to prevent interference with other spacecraft and systems.
- **Environmental Impact**: We assess the risks of **droplet contamination** in the event of a plasma shield failure, and employ **self-cleaning protocols**.

This project adheres to **international space safety standards** and **dual-use regulations** for defense-related technologies.

## Future Work

The research will continue to expand in collaboration with scientific and aerospace communities to evaluate the feasibility and integration of these shields for space missions, especially in debris-rich environments like LEO and deep-space missions.

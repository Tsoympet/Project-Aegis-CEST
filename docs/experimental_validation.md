# Experimental Validation of CEST

## Overview of Experimental Methods

The **Coupled-Envelope Shield Theory (CEST)** was tested through **bench-scale experiments**, including **laser plasma mirrors**, **REBCO HTS magnetic shields**, and **Whipple shielding** for hypervelocity impacts. Data collected from these tests were compared to theoretical predictions, validating the core components of the theory.

## Plasma Mirror Validation (PRF)

As described in the **Proof of Concept** section, the **liquid-sheet plasma mirrors** were tested in both **CO2** and **H2O feeds**. The experimental validation showed **PRF values** up to 0.85, demonstrating the capability of plasma mirrors for laser rejection.

## Magnetic Shielding (CDP)

Magnetic shielding was tested with **REBCO HTS coils**, where **deflection** of charged particles was measured. The results corroborated the theoretical **Larmor radius** scaling.

- **Measured Efficiency**: CDP reached 0.95, and the scaling laws matched theoretical predictions. Full test data is in the **raw_data/magnetic_field/** folder.

## Hypervelocity Impact Testing (KFI)

The **Whipple shield** experiments included testing **steel projectiles** at various velocities and standoff distances. The results were consistent with **BLE predictions**, showing the **KFI reduction** factor and energy absorption.

- **Data**: Impact data is available in the **raw_data/impact_testing/** directory.
